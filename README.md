# Engineering-Books
Softcopy of Engineering and Computer Science Books.
If you want a book{s} to be taken down, please contact me.
I do not own any of the books. Just doing my part sharing books to fellow engineering students. Taken from different sources.

I will keep updating the books based on recommendations and requests from my colleagues or anyone else. If you want to give a recommendation, DM @gigahidjrikaaa via Instagram.

Take note that this repo can disappear at ANY time due to copyright reasons.

# Personal Recommendations
These are the lists of books that I personally recommend. These books are the ones that I currently use in my study. Take note that I study Information Engineering at Universitas Gadjah Mada, where the curriculum is based on MIT (at least for the first 2 semesters).
